# User flow

(Explaining the user's steps before the SnapBacked application starts)

1. The user logs in to their Snapchat on the mobile app or in a browser, and requests their data by going to “Request your data: [https://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/downloadmydata](https://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/downloadmydata)”.
2. Then the user selects the **Export your Memories** and **Export JSON Files** options, continues, and chooses a date range. _(At SnapBacked we advise the user to first test the download by only selecting the date range as “last week”, so that there won’t be too much data to download, and so that Snapchat will be quicker to send the information to the user. Thus, the user will also be able to try out SnapBacked faster with less waiting time for both the email from Snapchat with the data, but also the download time of the actual files will be faster since there are less.)_ **Tip:** Start with Last Week to get a smaller export and try SnapBacked faster.
3. Then the user selects the email that the user wants Snapchat to send the data to.
4. **Note:** Step 1–3 is something that the user does themselves, and is not part of the functionality of the **SnapBacked** app. But SnapBacked will show a visualization and step-by-step guide of how to do it, to guide the user. After the user has requested the data from **Snapchat**, it should show in Snapchat: **“Your exports”** and information on when this request was created, and when the export will expire (usually within 3 days, thus SnapBacked should inform the user that Snapchat sets a deadline). If the user chooses **“Last Week”** date range, then it would typically just take **3–5 hours** before Snapchat sends the email. Note that longer time ranges and larger downloads take more time to process.
5. The user then gets a **(optional Windows toast) notification by SnapBacked** to check their email and see if Snapchat has sent the user an email with a link to download the data. The email subject is usually: **“Your Snapchat data is ready for download.”**
6. The user should download the file received by Snapchat, on either their phone or their PC. After this step, this is where the **SnapBacked** application will help the user. For the continuing user flow, we will assume that the user downloads the file on their PC (Windows computer).
7. The user should find the **ZIP file** in the **Downloads** folder, and it would be called something like this: `mydata~1761471504495.zip`. Size e.g. **22.91 KiB** (size varies). The export typically includes a folder called **html** (with a Chrome HTML document called: `memories_history`), another folder called **json** (with a JSON source file called: `memories history`), and an HTML document called **index**.
8. The user should open the **SnapBacked** application and drag and drop their ZIP file (e.g. `mydata~1761471504495.zip`) into an area on the front page of the SnapBacked application. This should start the **“SnapBacked Processing Flow”** (which downloads the pictures and videos, shows the expected time to download, and afterwards shows a gallery of the pictures and videos).
9. At last, the user can then view the gallery, and additional features. This is the end of the user flow.


# SnapBacked Processing Flow

(Explaining how the SnapBacked application should work, step by step)

1. **SnapBacked** application starts by showing a pop-up box with a visualization and step-by-step guide of how the user should request the data from **Snapchat**. It visualizes step 1–3 in **User flow**. At the bottom of the pop-up box, there should be a button saying **“I’m ready to continue”**. The guide also reminds users that exports typically **expire in ~3 days** (visible under “Your exports” in Snapchat) and recommends starting with **“Last Week”** for a faster first run.
2. The user should then keep the **SnapBacked** application open (in this example, on Windows computer) and drag and drop their ZIP file (e.g. `mydata~1761471504495.zip`) into an area (saying: **“Insert or drag and drop your zip file here”**) on the front page of the SnapBacked application. After this step the user’s responsibility ends. This should start the **“SnapBacked Processing Flow”** (which downloads the pictures and videos, shows the expected time to download, and afterwards shows a gallery of the pictures and videos). A more detailed explanation of the SnapBacked Processing Flow is described next.
3. The **SnapBacked** application should then download the pictures and videos from the ZIP file using the method based on the code from the folder **“Snapchat-All-Memories-Downloader”**. This folder has all the Python code to run this. The downloading code should consider that the Snapchat data consists of several different data types: video (**MP4**), pictures (sometimes without actual file type/extension; shown as “File”. Actually if you rename files like these to their existing name and add `.JPG` in the end, then it converts to a JPG file that is viewable in many picture gallery applications). There are also ZIP files which typically include an **MP4** file, and a **PNG** (which shows an overlay with text, which is what many users add to their pictures on Snapchat. However, when downloading these files, the picture or video might be separated from the text overlay, which is something to keep in mind). The **Snapchat-All-Memories-Downloader** code typically downloads the videos and pictures correctly, and renames them to their **created date**, and keeps the correct metadata date for when the video was originally created/modified. Each video typically has a size of **1,000 KB to 10,000 KB**. Video **MP4** files that are around **60 KB** usually have an error, either because of file type unsupported, or file extensions are incorrect, or the file is corrupt. The pictures that are downloaded are typically **JPG** files with a typical size of **40 KB to 800 KB**. _(Something to consider if it should be fixed is that the picture files that are downloaded usually have the correct file name which is the correct date they were taken, but the metadata showing when it was modified or created shows a wrong date, typically the date where the actual download happens. This is something that might need to be fixed.)_
4. **SnapBacked** application should start showing a visual progress bar to the user, showing how far it is with downloading the data. Once the download is done, it should show a text saying: **“Your Snapchat data has successfully and safely been downloaded. Press Next to continue”** — with a button saying **“Next”**.
5. After the user has pressed the button **“Next”**, the application should show a gallery with all the pictures and videos, sorted by date. In the bottom of the user interface there should be a horizontal tab or box with **3 icons** (from left to right showing: **1. Memories, 2. Gallery, 3. Profile**). The user interface should be simple and minimalistic. The user should be able to switch between a view showing the **“Gallery”** over to a view showing the **“Memories”**. And also a view showing the **“Profile.”** This is the end of the flow.

## Appendix: Technical notes for import (for developers; keeps core flow readable)

- Some images arrive **without extensions** (shown as generic “File”). Detect type via **magic bytes** and rename (e.g., add `.jpg`) so they’re viewable in standard galleries.
- Some memories arrive as **nested ZIPs** that contain an **MP4** and a **PNG overlay** (Snapchat text overlay). Extract both and **retain their association**.
- **Heuristic:** **MP4** files around **≤60 KB** are likely corrupt/unsupported — flag these and log them in the import report.
- When filesystem timestamps reflect the **download time**, normalize the photo/video **date created** from **EXIF**, **Snapchat JSON/HTML**, or **filename date** (in that order), and only then fall back to file system timestamps.
